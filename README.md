# Delicious Bites — Veg Only

Delicious Bites is a small vegetarian restaurant website (static HTML) with a simple menu and WhatsApp ordering link.

Summary of changes in this repo
- Added `index.html` (site entry) with a Veg‑Only badge, opening hours, address, logo placeholder, and accessibility improvements.
- Kept the README content as this Markdown file for clarity and repo hygiene.

Site preview
- To preview locally: open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or `open index.html`).
- To edit content: modify `index.html` (menu items, hours, address, banner, logo).

Enable GitHub Pages (publish the site)
1. Go to the repository Settings → Pages.
2. Under "Source", select branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`.
3. Click "Save". Your site will be published at:
   `https://kaushaljogi17-collab.github.io/deliciousbites-restaurant/` (it can take a minute to become available).
4. If you want a custom domain, add it in the Pages settings and configure DNS accordingly.

Notes & next steps
- Replace the logo placeholder image (`src` in the header) with your official logo URL for branding.
- If you want the README to display additional project details (license, contribution guide, deploy CI), tell me what to add.
- I can also (on approval) commit these files to `main` and enable GitHub Pages for you.
